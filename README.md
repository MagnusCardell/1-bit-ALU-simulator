Hamming Code Simulation
========

This project simulates the Hamming Code principle in that it can generate, check, and correct a 16 bit hexadecimal value. 


##Features
- A software replication of the logical gates of a 1-bit ALU. 
- Logical operations defined in blogic.h and combined in alu.cpp

##Get Started
These instructions will download the source files, compile the code, and get you started.

#####Download
    git clone https://github.com/MagnusCardell/1-bit_ALU_simulator.git alu_sim
#####Compile
    cd alu_sim
    g++ -o alu alu.cpp 
#####Execute
    ./alu

Now you see the resulting printout from the software ALU.
